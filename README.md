# Analysis of Classification Algorithm Comparison for Heart Disease Patient Prediction.
Heart disease is one of the perilous illnesses that can lead to fatality. With the advancement of technology and the rising prominence of machine learning, machine learning techniques can be employed to ascertain whether an individual is afflicted by heart disease or not. In the realm of machine learning, computers gain knowledge by scrutinizing data. The dataset employed in this study is the Heart Dataset. Diverse methodologies exist to determine whether an individual is susceptible to heart disease. This research endeavors to apply classification algorithms, specifically K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine, to this end. These four supervised learning algorithms will be subject to performance analysis via a confusion matrix. Upon conducting experiments on these four algorithms, it has been deduced that the most efficacious algorithm for heart disease prediction, based on the Heart dataset, is the Logistic Regression algorithm, with an accuracy rate of 89.65%.
